# LeetCode

### Solutions and examples from my LeetCode profile


#### Objective
The purpose of this project is to provide some of my solutions to the various problems on the popular code challenge site, LeetCode. As I have studied various algorithims that are popular to solve these questions, I want to reiterate my thought process in order to feel more confident when I come up to similar problems in the future. 

#### This is an ongoing project

Not all of my solutions are included here. The shield below tracks the running total of problems solved, and more will be added in the future.
